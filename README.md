# MLHC - Project 1 - Fabio, Jona and Lucia
 ### IMPORTANT
 You need to install chest_xray folder with images on the Part 2 folder, as it was too heavy to keep on github.

 For Neural Additive Models, it was not possible to install the package with pip in our linux (virtual or not) machines, as suggested in the github file. Therefore, we downloaded the package with the NAM architecture directly. It's in our github repo, and was downloaded directly from https://github.com/kherud/neural-additive-models-pt.

### GENERAL
In Part 1, we preprocessed the dataset with exploratory data analysis file, and saved the data in "preprocessed_heart_**" csv file. We then have a script for each of the models implemented, along their respective explainability/interpretability analysis.

In Part 2, we do a brief data visualization with ExploratoryDataAnalysis, than train, evaluate and visualize loss of the CNN model in the respective files, than apply all the explainability tests on files with the respective names.
